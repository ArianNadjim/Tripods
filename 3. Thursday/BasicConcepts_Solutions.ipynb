    "Brief Description:  \n",
    "1) Random variables of normal distribution and Bernoulli distribution will be studied;  \n",
    "2) The probability concepts include mean, variance, $L^p$ norm ($p < \\infty$), $L^{\\infty}$ norm, covariance;  \n",
    "3) The built-in functions in numpy will be called if they exist. In addition, all the probability concepts will be defined explicitly for illustrations;  \n",
    "4) Sample statistic will be used as an estimation for the corresponding probablity concept. The accuracy will be quantified, which lies in the theory of statistical inference. "

More precisely, let N:= sample size, then the sample could be viewed as a realization of N independent random variables of the standard normal distribution).\n",

For example, assume that the given random variable has variance bounded by 2, how many samples are needed for the estimation error to be within 0.01 with probability 0.9? (Hint: Chebyshev's inequality / VB, Corollary 1.2.5.)\n",
